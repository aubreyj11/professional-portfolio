## Description
This site's purpose is to showcase the projects that I have completed, give information about who I am, and give potential employers possible ways to contact me. I learned through this project to be very mindful when applying multiple CSS elements and not to let certain things overlap others. This website solves the problem of trying to find a place to showcase all of my projects.
